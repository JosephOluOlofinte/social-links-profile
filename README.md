## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Even though I've learned about CSS grid before now, I tried it out for the first time in this project. I am more of a flexbox guy, but I think grids are pretty cool too. 

I actually think Grid is better for certain layout situations where Flexbox may be a little bit problematic. For example, after playing around a bit with grid while building this project, I think I'd prefer display:grid to layout mobile view rather than display: flex; flex-direction: column.
